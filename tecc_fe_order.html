			<p>At The Electric Car Company, we source all our main block components from the best suppliers at the best price from all over the world. Build your own car from our available blocks and customise the result with add-ons; you can make it your very own at the price that suits your budget.</p>
			<p>Each and every car is assembled from block components by hand and our build crew then tests it thoroughly to ensure that our standards of quality are met. We only ever work on one vehicle at a time and our crew of professionals is small so each car takes on average between 3 to 7 days to fully assemble. Order yours now before the waiting queue gets too long: orders are fulfilled on a first come first serve basis!</p>
